## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sunny Verma, and I am an Offensive Security Consultant with 4+ years of experience performing closed-box web application, internal infrastructure, Active Directory and AWS cloud configuration assessments!

**SunnyVerma25/SunnyVerma25** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Because I was too lazy to define my whole profile, I decided to use the generic template to tell the world about myself :)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on obtaining my Burp Suite Certified Professional (BSCP), followed by OSWE (Offensive Security Web Expert)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently solving PortSwigger labs to complete my BSCP notes, and to improve my web application testing methodology
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on preparation for BSCP and OSWE, or web application security in general :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot an email at vsunny811@gmail.com :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe that everything happens for a reason (including anyone who browses to this profile, as that too had a purpose behind it). We all have a role to play in the universe. So if you feel things are not going in your favor, it's life trying to teach you a lesson, no matter how harsh it is :)
